        <h1>The History of katimamulilo SDA church</h1>
		<p> Katimamulilo SDA Church was formed in the year 2013, the reason behind the construction was a new church was because the mother <a href="https://gardenmainsdachurch.com">church Garden Main SDA Church</a> was unable to occupy the large number of congregants present at that time, so the leadership decided to rent a class room at a near by school<a href="https://ngwerereprimaryschool.com"> by the name of ngwerere primary</a> a numberof members moved from the main church and started worshiping from the newly forme comapany. leaders were choosen and given the responsibilty of running all the affairs of the newly formed company...... As years wen by the number of people at ngwerere grow as well, there arised a need of finding more space and a permannet place where a curch would be constructed. </p> <img src="../img/hand.jpg"> <!-- add an image alongside the historical text -->
